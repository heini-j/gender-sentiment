WOZ,11.5.23,Es ist kompliziert,The new start in asylum policy under SP Justice Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider is a long time coming. Small improvements stand in the way of major omissions.,3,2,1,,EBS
WW,17.8.23,Der Ukraine-Krieg erreicht die Schweizer Spitäler und Heime,"But that's exactly what it boils down to. In recent months, a network of private transport links has been established between Kiev and Swiss cities, transporting Ukrainians back and forth as if there were no war. The flow of war refugees from Ukraine is also continuing. Between 400 and 500 people are still arriving every week. The migration authorities of Federal Councillor Elisabeth Baume-Schneider (SP) had registered over 87,000 applications for S status by last week, and over 84,000 war refugees were granted this status. This includes 6685 people over the age of 65. Of course, it would be interesting to find out how the influx of elderly people has actually developed in recent weeks and months.",4,4,0,,EBS
WW,14.3.24,Schlegeleien im Bundeshaus,Thierry Burkart knows as much about politics as Elisabeth Baume-Schneider.,5,2,3,,EBS
WW,22.12.22,SMS an Sommaruga Kurs halten in der Asylpolitik Maillards VerbÃ¼ndete Dank an Appenzell,"Quite a few people doubt whether she could challenge the Bernese on the topic of climate, for example. After all, Rösti has been politicising this field for years and knows every detail. The anxious question among the Greens is: do the Greens have the right representatives in the Federal Council in Alain Berset and Elisabeth Baume-Schneider to stand up to Rösti?",3,0,3,,EBS
WOZ,23.2.23,«Mir läuft die Zeit davon»,"WOZ: Mrs Fehr, there was this intense moment during the Federal Council elections: When Elisabeth Baume-Schneider was elected, the camera showed the loser Eva Herzog in close-up. Herzog sat on the bench in the National Council chamber, seemingly in control, but quivering inside. Just one step away from power, now in complete powerlessness. Did you experience this moment in the same way?",5,2,3,,EBS
WW,10.10.24,"Nützt's nichts, kostet's viel",Placebo effect: Federal Councillor Baume-Schneider.,3,0,3,,EBS
WW,5.10.23,Das andere Gesicht von Elisabeth Baume-Schneider,"Daniel Raeber decided to pay Baume-Schneider fifty francs, but expressly informed her chief of staff, who had requested the payment. The latter smelled the danger for his boss and asked Raeber not to pay the bill after all. What followed was an angry phone call from Government Councillor Baume-Schneider to the rector. The latter blamed everything on Raeber, who had refused to pay the tiny fine. For twenty minutes, he had to listen to extremely loud accusations and insults. In the end, the fine was not paid by the state - but from then on, Raeber had a dangerous enemy in Baume-Schneider.",1,8,7,,EBS
WW,3.10.24,Dreissig Jahre Prämienschock,Immigration as the main driver of healthcare costs is ignored by Baume-Schneider.,2,2,0,,EBS
WW,23.2.23,Diese Woche,"We live in peace and prosperity, but there is a certain coldness in society. When figures like Albert Rösti or Elisabeth Baume-Schneider appear, who laugh cheerfully, approach people and have no airs and graces, it seems suspicious at first. You ask yourself: Are they allowed to be so cheerful? Do they not see the seriousness of the problems?",4,8,4,,EBS
WW,8.12.22,Diese Woche,"Two very likeable politicians, pulse warmers, perhaps not a disadvantage at all, are now moving into the Federal Council: SVP favourite Albert Rösti, Bernese Oberland post champion with mischievous Adolf Ogi potential, and the Jura SP member of the Council of States Elisabeth Baume-Schneider. The outsider made a lightning rise, also to the visible astonishment, indeed annoyance, of her own party, which checkmated itself with its women's ticket. Eva Herzog, the party leadership's favourite, all too cool and somewhat arrogant, remained defeated because a number of parliamentarians gave their vote first to Daniel Jositsch, the secret kingmaker, and then to Elisabeth Baume-Schneider.",6,6,0,,EBS
WOZ,1.2.24,Fatale Sparneurose,"The interview vividly reveals the simple programme of Keller-Sutter's financial policy: no debt under any circumstances and spend as little money as possible. As a consequence, this means that our Finance Minister seriously wants to tackle the climate disaster, which is becoming increasingly life-threatening without drastic measures and a transformation of our energy and entire economic system, with austerity programmes. And that she is uncritically supported in this endeavour both in the Federal Council and in Parliament by the respective conservative majority.",1,2,1,,KKS
WOZ,15.8.24,Keller-Sutter plant ihre Abwahl,"The bill bears the signature of Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, who can increasingly be described as a financial centre minister. In doing so, she is also ignoring the majority of consultation responses, which supported financing through VAT and a percentage of wages - and rejected a reduction in the federal contribution.",2,0,2,,KKS
WW,16.12.21,Konflikten weicht er nicht aus Keine Grüne in Sicht,"Nevertheless, the FDP's left-wing opponents have a tiny chance. They would have to be able to come up with either a Green candidate from Ticino or a woman to replace Keller-Sutter. Interestingly, there are now voices among the Green parliamentarians who consider the latter scenario to be more realistic - in the knowledge that Cassis is unelectable as a representative of Ticino.",5,6,1,,KKS
WW,24.3.22,Forsche Forderungen Bundesratskollegen via SMS informiert,"It is tragic that it had to come to this. He wanted to bring a breath of fresh air to the FDFA and re-emphasise foreign economic policy more than his predecessors Didier Burkhalter (FDP) and Micheline Calmy-Rey (SP), who jetted around the globe as world saviours. It also took courage, together with his party colleague and Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, to shoot down the framework agreement with the EU against the resistance of his diplomats.",4,7,3,,KKS
WW,21.4.22,Gegenseitige Demontage in den Medien Gemeinsame Entscheide? Dammbruch in der Corona-Krise,"The government's statement on the atrocities committed by the Russians against civilians in the Ukrainian town of Butsha provided a timely illustration of this. President of the Swiss Confederation and Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis (FDP) commented cautiously on this act, especially as it was not clear exactly what had happened there. He was criticised by the media for this. Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter has now intervened. She condemned the incident in Butscha to the media as a war crime and more or less announced tougher sanctions. This was problematic in two respects: firstly, she stabbed her colleague in the back, and secondly, the Federal Council had not yet discussed tougher sanctions at that time.",1,2,1,,KKS
WOZ,16.12.21,Der Bund bleibt stur,"The last time naturalisations were carried out in Switzerland was during the Second World War, when Nazis in particular were stripped of their citizenship, the last time being in 1947. It was only after 11 September 2001 that passport revocation became an issue again, and it is regulated in detail in the new Citizenship Act, which came into force in 2018. Under Federal Councillor Karin Keller-Sutter, the Department of Justice began applying the corresponding Article 42 to jihad travellers in 2019. Only dual nationals are to be expatriated, as it is contrary to international law to create stateless persons. However, Fionnuala Ni Aolain, UN rapporteur on human rights in the fight against terrorism, argues that the fact that only dual nationals are affected violates the prohibition of discrimination under international law. For this reason, expatriations are absolutely forbidden, she tells WOZ.",3,1,2,,KKS
WW,4.7.24,Der Weg aus der Finanzmisere,Keller-Sutter has now made the decisive realisation. That gives us some hope. The independent treasurer faces a Herculean task. She must convince her Federal Council colleagues and Parliament that there is an urgent need for action. ,7,4,3,,KKS
WOZ,26.9.24,«Die FDP hat sich ideologisch verengt»,The savings plan was already available as a report from the group of experts. Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter then gave the whole thing the appearance of a negotiation by convening round tables ...,4,3,1,,KKS
WW,30.5.24,Göttin des Gemetzels,"Moderation, please: Finance Minister Keller-Sutter.",4,1,3,,KKS
WOZ,12.9.24,Revanchismus mit Sparhammer,"The Federal Council - and first and foremost FDP Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter - believes that austerity is a lever to undo the social progress made in recent years - and at the same time to restructure Switzerland according to its own ideas. They even want to undermine referendums on the AHV and climate protection. At the same time, the army is to undergo an unprecedented rearmament, even though there has not been a single referendum on the issue to date. Billions and billions are being spent on heavy metal and gunpowder, while funding for development cooperation and participation in international organisations is being slashed.",1,0,1,,KKS
WW,27.6.24,Neben den Fussballschuhen,"Politicians never look as cheap as when they chum up with sport. Annalena Baerbock responded to Cassis by wishing for a German group win. She was immediately accused of a lack of interest in football and ‘sucking up’. Cassis also got his comeuppance: ‘Join the EU like Berset’ or ‘US puppet’ was still nice. Because of him, ‘Switzerland is now threatened with war’. In contrast to the politicians, however, our footballers stuck to the principle of neutrality: they played Germany one on one.",1,2,1,,IC
WW,30.5.24,Staatssekretär Alexandre Fasel und die Kunst des doppelten Auftritts: Erzählt er bei den EU-Freunden wirklich dasselbe wie bei den Skeptikern?,"In fact, the planned agreement is now being finalised in quick succession. The planned meeting between Sefcovic and Cassis shows that those involved expect the negotiations between Bern and Brussels to be finalised before the end of the year. ‘This is the goal formulated by the Federal Council,’ Fasel states. The treaty would be debated in Parliament in 2025, and the historic referendum on the deal with the European Union would probably take place next autumn.",5,6,1,,IC
WW,14.12.23,Beat Jans kann's,"It will be interesting to see how the Basel native gets on with SVP Federal Councillors Guy Parmelin and Albert Rösti, whom he took on hard as a National Councillor. As things stand today, the Basel native will probably take over the Department of Home Affairs (FDHA) from Alain Berset. Unless his party colleague Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, who does not feel comfortable in the Department of Justice and Police (FDJP), harbours ambitions to take over the FDHA. Viola Amherd and Ignazio Cassis have so far given no indication that they want to change.",5,5,0,,IC
WW,23.11.23,Machtrausch im Bundesrat,Now the pressure is on: politician Cassis.,5,2,3,,IC
WW,23.2.23,Jeden Handlungsspielraum verloren Eigentumsgarantie zertrümmert,"Ignazio Cassis is certainly neither William Tell nor Winkelried at the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. This would not even be necessary, but he should at least uphold the constitutional order of our country - instead of shattering the guarantee of property with the following frivolous sentence: ‘The frozen Russian funds are a possible source for reconstruction.’",2,1,1,,IC
WOZ,23.6.22,Bumerang für die FDP,"By emphasising its tough asylum policy, the FDP is apparently preparing for the 2023 election campaign. It is hoping to win voters from the SVP. The reverse effect is more likely: it could lose even more progressive voters to the GLP. For Karin Keller-Sutter, the paper could even prove to be a boomerang. If she is threatened with losing a seat in the Federal Council elections, Ignazio Cassis has the better cards thanks to the support of the SVP.",6,3,3,,IC
WW,24.3.22,Diese Woche,"In its initial astonishment, the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper spoke of a ‘rather unusual appearance for a Swiss president’. Whereby by ‘unusual’ it actually meant shameful, embarrassing, disgraceful. Ignazio Cassis' participation in the Ukraine demonstration on the Bundesplatz irritated friend and foe alike. Even when ‘dear Volodymyr’ spat at the Swiss banks and the Nestlé company, the liberal politician cheered on his ‘dear friend’ Zelenskyi.",0,4,4,,IC
WW,13.1.22,Wie bei einem Wettstreit Politisch motivierte Aussagen Behördlicher Blindflug Chancen für eine Neuausrichtung,"However, Cassis' open statement shows that the Federal Council is slowly changing its paradigm. Gone are the days when, as in the case of Hürzeler, those responsible marched out as if all questions had long been answered in this pandemic.",4,5,1,,IC
WW,17.2.22,"Spittelers Aufruf ""Peinliche Zwängerei"" Mit Bravour gemeistert Aufstand im Aussendepartement","The threat of war in Eastern Europe? Foreign Minister Cassis could not have signalled greater distance. But appearances are deceptive. At a time when the outbreak of war in Europe can be expected at any time, President Cassis is marching ahead like a cheerful tour guide to direct neutral Switzerland to the UN Security Council, the body that makes binding decisions on war and peace under international law.",3,2,1,,IC
WW,31.3.22,Matterhorn vs. Neutralität Jahrhunderte ohne Kriege Unbehagen im Kleinstaat,"If there is a crisis in this country, it is a crisis of state policy. Based on the Embargo Act, the Federal Council has damaged neutrality by adopting EU sanctions under pressure from the public and from abroad. ‘Neutrality is not affected by this,’ said Cassis. Really? The media abroad interpreted the Federal Council's decision as a breach of neutrality, as did the US President in his State of the Union speech.",2,1,1,,IC
WW,23.2.23,Anspruchsvoller Stoff! Politik als literarisches Spiel Kleiner Spiesser in uns Arroganz und Nächstenliebe Mehr Emotionen,"‘I'm more of a Wittgensteinian on talk shows"": philosopher Pfister.",4,7,3,,GPF
WW,1.9.22,Anschleichen an die Nato Wir sind Merkel Überlegung der Einflüsterer Banken nehmen Schweiz in Geiselhaft,"Nevertheless, the Zug National Councillor rejects the liberal ‘no alternatives’ talk. Pfister knows that there are other options and lists the following: ‘Continuation of the position after the conquest of Crimea, preventing Switzerland from circumventing the sanctions. Neither the above option nor supporting any sanctions’. Personally, however, he believes that accepting the sanctions is the right stance. ‘In view of Switzerland's importance for Russia in economic terms, it would hardly have been possible to ensure or do everything possible to ensure that Russia's war was not (co-)financed from Switzerland without supporting the sanctions,’ says Pfister. You can think what you like of him: at least he dares to show his colours.",6,6,0,,GPF
WW,1.9.22,"Euphorie für die ""Neue Seidenstrasse"" Wie eine Löwin","National Councillors Pfister, Schneider-Schneiter.",5,2,3,,GPF
WW,20.6.24,Lieber Sascha Ruefer,"Well, your emotional outburst was also somewhat sympathetic - when do the German-speaking Swiss dare to give free rein to their emotions? But it doesn't fit in with the serenity we expect from a football reporter. Nevertheless, you remain my favourite sports reporter because you commentate competently and also let out a few quips that occur to you spontaneously. So I can't agree with Gerhard Pfister, the centre president who asked SRF (on X): ‘Won't you slowly replace him or at least provide him with a competent co-commentator? His shouting performance during the Switzerland-Hungary match motivates people to fly the flag for ARD/ZDF or ORF for the rest of the tournament, as has been the case for years.’",3,4,1,,GPF
WW,30.11.23,Gerhard-Pfister-Festspiele,"But the claim fits in perfectly with the narrative that Pfister seems to be successfully promoting these days. It says that Switzerland has a system with three poles: the SP and the Greens on the left, the SVP and the FDP on the right, and a centre in between led by his centrist party. For Pfister, the bourgeois bloc with the Christian Democrats, the Free Democrats and the People's Party is passé, a relic from the past destroyed by the SVP.",3,3,0,,GPF
WW,19.5.22,Waffenlieferungen auf Umwegen Stumme Intellektuelle,Anyone who sought a dialogue with the philosophy graduate afterwards ended up at the Zug National Council. Pfister let it be known via Centre General Secretary Gianna Luzio that he did not wish to comment further on the subject. Breaking a taboo with a short message on a social network on a Sunday evening and then disappearing - the former US president could not have done better.,5,8,3,,GPF
WW,30.5.24,«Mit der Hälfte muss sie leben können»,"My impression: Pfister will bite Cina to death politically in the near future. And after the success of the Electricity Act, Rösti will push the Zurich SVP and its vassal Dettling into a corner when it comes to the SRG. Because the Bernese felt is a good cloth.",4,6,2,,GPF
WW,27.7.23,"""Einer für alle, alle für einen""","Gerhard Pfister, 60, National Councillor, Centre/ZG: My wish for Switzerland and its inhabitants is that cohesion, balance and the willingness to find solutions together are maintained. Direct democracy, respect for institutions and minorities are the pillars of the Swiss model of success. Let us take care of them.",5,3,2,,GPF
WW,16.3.23,Solidarität mit Brüssel Journalisten bejubeln Burkarts Kurs,"But it wasn't just the Social Democrats who were shipwrecked. Centre Party President Gerhard Pfister, who sparked the whole debate a year ago, also ran aground. He had campaigned incessantly for a softening of the export guidelines, even claiming that Switzerland was being defended by Ukraine, which is why it was in the country's interests to support Ukraine's defence.",2,7,5,,GPF
WOZ,23.11.23,Hauptsache Entertainment,"At the Swiss Media Forum in autumn 2022, Wanner suggested that the Federal Council could invite tenders for licences for individual broadcasts, for which private broadcasters could also apply. Two months later, Centre President Gerhard Pfister called for a second licence for national television in CH Media's in-house newspaper. Whoever wins the bid will receive around CHF 150 million from the licence fee pot to broadcast an information programme on radio and television in all national languages. ‘Will SRF soon have competition at national level?’ was the headline in the “Aargauer Zeitung”. Wanner always denied that he was planning a national channel. But with his TV arsenal, he would most likely have the prerequisites for this.",5,5,0,,GPF
